Java visualization package to help you introspect your ant's hive mind.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To package jar for use in your own personal ant project run this:
./sbt package

To package up a sources jar run this:
./sbt package-src

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Getting started using the Scala Starter-Kit:

object DebugBot extends App {
  val pipeIn = new PipedInputStream()
  val pipeOut = new PipedOutputStream(pipeIn)
  val hiveMind = new HiveMind(System.in, pipeOut)
  new Thread(new Runnable() {
    def run() {
      hiveMind.run()
    }
  }).start()

  new AntsGame(pipeIn).run(new MyBot())
}

Now simply run DebugBot in lieu of MyBot. You will need to include the HiveMind jar in your classpath.

Getting started using Java

You should be able to do the same thing as the Scala kit (Lasantha, you should give your example here). You will however need to include either scala_library.jar in addition to HiveMind.jar or else run your java program in scala.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Ideas in the making:
- Register callbacks with HiveMind to get back data from MyBot at the end of each round.
- Each callback explains how to visualize itself.
- Visualize HeatMaps
- Visualize Tile Sets (think explored vs unexplored vs tiles along some 'main' path.)
- Visualize Rectangles
- Visualize FoW
- Make it obvious which tiles your ants have not yet seen at all.
- Remember Hills and draw them closed once detected as being closed.
- Allow end-user to evaluate each type of visualization one at a time.
- Show real value on mouse hover.

And much much more =).
